# Vagrant - or - how to code in your local computer
Sandboxes are great, but you can also do your ALX assessments on your local computer - having a virtual machine (VM) is the perfect tool for that.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* What is a virtual machine
* What is Vagrant
* Who wrote Vagrant
* What is Ubuntu
* What does “Ubuntu” mean
* How to use VMs with Vagrant
* What does the command uname do

# Tasks
## 0. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account
You will need Git for this project, you might have to install it on your computer if it’s not done yet.

* Configure your basic info (name, email) on your local machine – they will be part of your commits. Tips
On GitHub.com:

* Using the graphic interface on the website, create the repository (if it’s not done yet)
* Description: > This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer
* Public repo:zero_day
* No > README, >.gitignore, or license
On your computer, open a terminal and do the following:

* Navigate to your home directory. [Tips](http://https://linuxconfig.org/single-linux-command-to-return-to-home-directory"Tips").

* Create a directory > zero_day. [link]( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BashScripting"Tips").
* Navigate to this new directory. Tips
* Initialize git and add the remote origin
* Create a file >README.md with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small Markdown text to present this project. This file is mandatory in projects
* Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server / origin (Note: You will probably need to *set your login/password to push to the remote server)
Good job!

You pushed your first file in your **Strong** first repository of **Strong** the first task of your **Strong** first School project.
